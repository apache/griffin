[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-griffin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apache/incubator-griffin) [![License: Apache 2.0](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8cb994f6c4a156c623fe057fccd7fb7d7d2e8c9b/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f6c6963656e73652d417061636865253230322d3445423142412e737667)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)    

Apache Griffin is a model driven data quality solution for modern data systems. It provides a standard process to define data quality measures, execute, report, as well as an unified dashboard across multiple data systems. 

## Getting Started


You can try Griffin in docker following the [docker guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-griffin/blob/master/griffin-doc/docker/griffin-docker-guide.md).

To run Griffin at local, you can follow instructions below.

### Prerequisites
You need to install following items 
- jdk (1.8 or later versions).
- mysql.
- Postgresql.
- npm (version 6.0.0+).
- [Hadoop](http://apache.claz.org/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.0/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz) (2.6.0 or later), you can get some help [here](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html).
-  [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) (version 1.6.x, griffin does not support 2.0.x at current), if you want to install Pseudo Distributed/Single Node Cluster, you can get some help [here](http://why-not-learn-something.blogspot.com/2015/06/spark-installation-pseudo.html).
- [Hive](http://apache.claz.org/hive/hive-1.2.1/apache-hive-1.2.1-bin.tar.gz) (version 1.2.1 or later), you can get some help [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-RunningHive).
    You need to make sure that your spark cluster could access your HiveContext.
- [Livy](http://archive.cloudera.com/beta/livy/livy-server-0.3.0.zip), you can get some help [here](http://livy.io/quickstart.html).
    Griffin need to schedule spark jobs by server, we use livy to submit our jobs.
    For some issues of Livy for HiveContext, we need to download 3 files, and put them into HDFS.
    ```
    datanucleus-api-jdo-3.2.6.jar
    datanucleus-core-3.2.10.jar
    datanucleus-rdbms-3.2.9.jar
    ```
- ElasticSearch. 
	ElasticSearch works as a metrics collector, Griffin produces metrics to it, and our default UI get metrics from it, you can use your own way as well.

### Configuration

Create database 'quartz' in mysql
```
mysql -u username -e "create database quartz" -p
```
Init quartz tables in mysql by service/src/main/resources/Init_quartz.sql
```
mysql -u username -p quartz < service/src/main/resources/Init_quartz.sql
```


You should also modify some configurations of Griffin for your environment.

- <b>service/src/main/resources/application.properties</b>

    ```
    # jpa
    spring.datasource.url = jdbc:postgresql://<your IP>:5432/quartz?autoReconnect=true&useSSL=false
    spring.datasource.username = <user name>
    spring.datasource.password = <password>
    spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
    spring.datasource.driverClassName = org.postgresql.Driver
    spring.jpa.show-sql = true
    
    # hive metastore
    hive.metastore.uris = thrift://<your IP>:9083
    hive.metastore.dbname = <hive database name>    # default is "default"
    
    # external properties directory location, ignore it if not required
    external.config.location =

	# login strategy, default is "default"
	login.strategy = <default or ldap>

	# ldap properties, ignore them if ldap is not enabled
	ldap.url = ldap://hostname:port
	ldap.email = @example.com
	ldap.searchBase = DC=org,DC=example
	ldap.searchPattern = (sAMAccountName={0})

	# hdfs, ignore it if you do not need predicate job
	fs.defaultFS = hdfs://<hdfs-default-name>

	# elasticsearch
	elasticsearch.host = <your IP>
	elasticsearch.port = <your elasticsearch rest port>
	# authentication properties, uncomment if basic authentication is enabled
	# elasticsearch.user = user
	# elasticsearch.password = password
    ```

- <b>measure/src/main/resources/env.json</b> 
	```
	"persist": [
	    ...
	    {
			"type": "http",
			"config": {
		        "method": "post",
		        "api": "http://<your ES IP>:<ES rest port>/griffin/accuracy"
			}
		}
	]
	```
	Put the modified env.json file into HDFS.
	
- <b>service/src/main/resources/sparkJob.properties</b>
    ```
    sparkJob.file = hdfs://<griffin measure path>/griffin-measure.jar
    sparkJob.args_1 = hdfs://<griffin env path>/env.json
    
    sparkJob.jars = hdfs://<datanucleus path>/spark-avro_2.11-2.0.1.jar\
	    hdfs://<datanucleus path>/datanucleus-api-jdo-3.2.6.jar\
	    hdfs://<datanucleus path>/datanucleus-core-3.2.10.jar\
	    hdfs://<datanucleus path>/datanucleus-rdbms-3.2.9.jar
	    
	spark.yarn.dist.files = hdfs:///<spark conf path>/hive-site.xml
	
    livy.uri = http://<your IP>:8998/batches
    spark.uri = http://<your IP>:8088
    ```
    - \<griffin measure path> is the location you should put the jar file of measure module.
    - \<griffin env path> is the location you should put the env.json file.
    - \<datanucleus path> is the location you should put the 3 jar files of livy, and the spark avro jar file if you need.
    - \<spark conf path> is the location of spark conf directory.
    
### Build and Run

Build the whole project and deploy. (NPM should be installed)

  ```
  mvn clean install
  ```
 
Put jar file of measure module into \<griffin measure path> in HDFS

```
cp measure/target/measure-<version>-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar measure/target/griffin-measure.jar
hdfs dfs -put measure/target/griffin-measure.jar <griffin measure path>/
  ```

After all environment services startup, we can start our server.

  ```
  java -jar service/target/service.jar
  ```
    
After a few seconds, we can visit our default UI of Griffin (by default the port of spring boot is 8080).

  ```
  http://<your IP>:8080
  ```

You can use UI following the steps  [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-griffin/blob/master/griffin-doc/ui/user-guide.md).

**Note**: The front-end UI is still under development, you can only access some basic features currently.


### Build and Debug

If you want to develop Griffin, please follow [this document](griffin-doc/dev/dev-env-build.md), to skip complex environment building work.
