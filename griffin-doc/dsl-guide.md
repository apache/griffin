# Apache Griffin DSL Guide
Griffin DSL is designed for DQ measurement, as a SQL-like language, trying to describe the DQ domain request.

## Griffin DSL Syntax Description
Griffin DSL is SQL-like, case insensitive, and easy to learn.

### Supporting process
- logical operation: not, and, or, in, between, like, is null, is nan, =, !=, <=, >=, <, >
- mathematical operation: +, -, *, /, %
- sql statement: as, where, group by, having, order by, limit


### Keywords
- `null, nan, true, false`
- `not, and, or`
- `in, between, like, is`
- `as, where, group, by, having, order, desc, asc, limit`

### Operators
- `!, &&, ||, =, !=, <, >, <=, >=, <>`
- `+, -, *, /, %`
- `(, )`
- `., [, ]`

### Literals
- **string**: any string surrounded with a pair of " or ', with escape charactor \ if any request.  
	e.g. `"test", 'string 1', "hello \" world \" "`
- **number**: double or integer number.  
	e.g. `123, 33.5`
- **time**: a integer with unit in a string, will be translated to a integer number in millisecond.  
	e.g. `3d, 5h, 4ms`
- **boolean**: boolean value directly.  
	e.g. `true, false`

### Selections
- **selection head**: data source name.  
	e.g. `source, target`
- **all field selection**: * or with data source name ahead.  
	e.g. `*, source.*, target.*`
- **field selection**: field name or with data source name ahead.  
	e.g. `source.age, target.name, user_id`
- **index selection**: interget between square brackets "[]" with field name ahead.  
	e.g. `source.attributes[3]`
- **function selection**: function name with brackets "()", with field name ahead or not.  
	e.g. `count(*), *.count(), source.user_id.count(), max(source.age)`
- **alias**: declare an alias after a selection.  
	e.g. `source.user_id as id, target.user_name as name`

### Math expressions
- **math factor**: literal or function or selection or math exression with brackets.  
	e.g. `123, max(1, 2, 3, 4), source.age, (source.age + 13)`
- **unary math expression**: unary math operator with factor.  
	e.g. `-(100 - source.score)`
- **binary math expression**: math factors with binary math operators.  
	e.g. `source.age + 13, score * 2 + ratio`

### Logical expression
- **in**: in clause like sql.  
	e.g. `source.country in ("USA", "CHN", "RSA")`
- **between**: between clause like sql.  
	e.g. `source.age between 3 and 30, source.age between (3, 30)`
- **like**: like clause like sql.  
	e.g. `source.name like "%abc%"`
- **logical factor**:
