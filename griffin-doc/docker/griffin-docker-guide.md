# Apache Griffin Docker Guide
Griffin docker images are pre-built on docker hub, users can pull them to try griffin in docker.

## Environment preparation
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Increase vm.max_map_count of your local machine, to use elasticsearch.
    ```
    sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
    ```
## Pull the Docker Images
   Here lists the griffin and dependent environment docker images:
   - `bhlx3lyx7/svc_msr`: This image contains mysql, hadoop, hive, spark, livy, griffin service, griffin measure, and some prepared demo data, it works as a single node spark cluster, providing spark engine and griffin service.
   - `bhlx3lyx7/elasticsearch`: This image is based on official elasticsearch, adding some configurations to enable cors requests, to provide elasticsearch service for metrics persist.
   - `bhlx3lyx7/kafka`: This image contains kafka 0.8, and some demo streaming data, to provide streaming data source in streaming mode.
   - `zookeeper:3.5`: This image is official zookeeper, to provide zookeeper service in streaming mode.
	
   Pull the images by the following commands.
   ```
    docker pull bhlx3lyx7/svc_msr:0.2.0
    docker pull bhlx3lyx7/elasticsearch
    docker pull bhlx3lyx7/kafka
    docker pull zookeeper:3.5
   ```
   Or you can pull the images faster through mirror acceleration if you are in China.
   ```
    docker pull registry.docker-cn.com/bhlx3lyx7/svc_msr:0.2.0
    docker pull registry.docker-cn.com/bhlx3lyx7/elasticsearch
    docker pull registry.docker-cn.com/bhlx3lyx7/kafka
    docker pull registry.docker-cn.com/zookeeper:3.5
   ```
## Start the Containers
After pulling the images, you can run the docker image in [Batch mode](#how-to-use-griffin-docker-images-in-batch-mode)(always the first choice) or [Streaming mode](#how-to-use-griffin-docker-images-in-streaming-mode)(only if you need a streaming environment like kafka data source). Choose one mode and follow step1&2 to start the docker container.

### How to use griffin docker images in batch mode
1. Copy [docker-compose-batch.yml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-griffin/blob/master/griffin-doc/docker/svc_msr/docker-compose-batch.yml) to your work path.
2. In your work path, start docker containers by using docker compose, wait for about one minutes, then griffin service is ready.
    ```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-batch.yml up -d
    ```
3. Now you can try griffin APIs by using postman after importing the [json files](https://github.com/apache/incubator-griffin/tree/master/griffin-doc/service/postman).
    In which you need to modify the environment `BASE_PATH` value into `<your local IP address>:38080`.
4. You can try the api `Basic -> Get griffin version`, to make sure griffin service has started up.
5. Add an accuracy measure through api `Measures -> Add measure`, to create a measure in griffin.
6. Add a job to through api `jobs -> Add job`, to schedule a job to execute the measure. In the example, the schedule interval is 5 minutes.
7. After some minutes, you can get the metrics from elasticsearch.
    ```
    curl -XGET '<your local IP address>:39200/griffin/accuracy/_search?pretty&filter_path=hits.hits._source' -d '{"query":{"match_all":{}},  "sort": [{"tmst": {"order": "asc"}}]}'
    ```

### How to use griffin docker images in streaming mode
1. Copy [docker-compose-streaming.yml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-griffin/blob/master/griffin-doc/docker/svc_msr/docker-compose-streaming.yml) to your work path.
2. In your work path, start docker containers by using docker compose, wait for about one minutes, then griffin service is ready.
    ```
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-streaming.yml up -d
    ```
3. Enter the griffin docker container.
    ```
    docker exec -it griffin bash
    ```
4. Switch into the measure directory.
    ```
    cd ~/measure
    ```
5. Execute the script of streaming-accu, to execute streaming accuracy measurement.
    ```
    ./streaming-accu.sh
    ```
   You can trace the log in streaming-accu.log.
    ```
    tail -f streaming-accu.log
    ```
6. Limited by the docker container resource, you can only execute accuracy or profiling separately.
   If you want to try streaming profiling measurement, please kill the streaming-accu process first.
    ```
    kill -9 `ps -ef | awk '/griffin-measure/{print $2}'`
    ```
   Then clear the checkpoint directory and other related directories of last streaming job.
    ```
    ./clear.sh
    ```
   Execute the script of streaming-prof, to execute streaming profiling measurement.
    ```
    ./streaming-prof.sh
    ```
   You can trace the log in streaming-prof.log.
    ```
    tail -f streaming-prof.log
    ```
