#About predicates

##Overview
The purpose of predicates is obligate Griffin to check certain conditions before starting SparkSubmitJob. 
Depending on these conditions Griffin need to start or not start the measurement.

##Configure predicates

For configuring predicates need add property to measure json:
```
{
    ...
     "data.sources": [
        ...
         "connectors": [
                   "predicates": [
                       {
                         "type": "file.exist",
                         "config": {
                           "root.path": "/path/to/",
                           "path": "file.ext,file2.txt"
                         }
                       }
                   ],
         ...
         
     ]
}
```

Possible values for predicates.type:
- "file.exist" - in this case creates predicate with class org.apache.griffin.core.job.FileExistPredicator. This predicate checks existence of files before starting Spark jobs.
 ```
                     {
                         "type": "file.exist",
                         "config": {
                           "root.path": "/path/to/",
                           "path": "file.ext,file2.txt"
                         }
                       }
```

- "custom" - in this case required transmit class name in the property "class" in config. 
This example creates same predicate like in previous example
```
                     {
                         "type": "custom",
                         "config": {
                           "class": "org.apache.griffin.core.job.FileExistPredicator",
                           "root.path": "/path/to/",
                           "path": "file.ext,file2.txt"
                         }
                       }
```
It important to notice that predicate class must satisfy follow conditions:
- implement interface **org.apache.griffin.core.job.Predicator**
- have constructor with argument of type **org.apache.griffin.core.job.entity.SegmentPredicate**

##Deployment custom predicates
For the creating custom predicate you need 
1. Build the Griffin service using command
As a result, two artifacts will be built  
- **service-VERSION.jar** - executable Spring-Boot application
- **service-VERSION-lib.jar** - jar, which we can use as a dependency
This step is necessary because we can't use executable Spring-Boot application as a dependency in our plugin. 
2. Create module and add dependency that was built in previous step
```
         <dependency>
             <groupId>org.apache.griffin</groupId>
             <artifactId>service</artifactId>
             <classifier>lib</classifier>
             <version>${griffin.version}</version>
             <scope>provided</scope>
         </dependency>
```
3. Create a Predicate class, which should, as mentioned earlier, implement the Predicator interface and have a constructor with an argument of type SegmentPredicate
4. Build the module into a jar file and put it in any folder (for example /path-to-jar)
5. Start the Griffin service application using command 
```
java -cp target/service-VERSION.jar -Dloader.path=/path-to-jar/ org.springframework.boot.loader.PropertiesLauncher
```
