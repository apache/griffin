# Measure Batch Sample
Apache Griffin measures consist of batch measure and streaming measure, this document merely gives the batch measure sample.

## Batch Accuracy Sample
```

  "name": "accu_batch",

  "process.type": "BATCH",

  "data.sources": [
    {
      "name": "source",

    ]
  },
  
  "sinks": ["CONSOLE", "ELASTICSEARCH"]
}
```
Above is the configure file of batch accuracy job.  

### Data source
In this sample, we use avro file as source and target.  

### Evaluate rule
In this accuracy sample, the rule describes the match condition: `src.user_id = tgt.user_id AND upper(src.first_name) = upper(tgt.first_name) AND src.last_name = tgt.last_name`.  
The accuracy metrics will be persisted as metric, with miss column named "miss_count", total column named "total_count", matched column named "matched_count".  
The miss records of source will be persisted as record.  

## Batch Profiling Sample

  "data.sources": [
    {
      "name": "source",
      "connectors": [
        {
          "type": "HIVE",

            "database": "default",
            "table.name": "src"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],

  "evaluate.rule": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "dsl.type": "griffin-dsl",
        "dq.type": "PROFILING",
        "out.dataframe.name": "prof",
        "rule": "select max(age) as `max_age`, min(age) as `min_age` from source",
        "out": [
          {
            "type": "metric",
            "name": "prof"
          }        
        ]        
      },
      {
        "dsl.type": "griffin-dsl",
        "dq.type": "PROFILING",
        "out.dataframe.name": "name_grp",
        "rule": "select name, count(*) as cnt from source group by name",
        "out": [
          {
            "type": "metric",
            "name": "name_grp",
            "flatten": "array"
          }        
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
   
  "sinks": ["CONSOLE", "ELASTICSEARCH"]
}
```
Above is the configure file of batch profiling job.  

### Data source
In this sample, we use hive table as source.  

### Evaluate rule
In this profiling sample, the rule describes the profiling request: `select max(age) as max_age, min(age) as min_age from source` and `select name, count(*) as cnt from source group by name`.
The profiling metrics will be persisted as metric, with the max and min value of age, and count group by name, like this: `{"max_age": 53, "min_age": 11, "name_grp": [{"name": "Adam", "cnt": 13}, {"name": "Fred", "cnt": 2}]}`.
